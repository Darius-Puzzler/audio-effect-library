# Analog Modeling Delay - Chapter 14 Homework 2

## Description
An analog-style delay effect that emulates the characteristics of vintage bucket-brigade delay (BBD) circuits, including:

- Analog-style filtering
- Saturation and non-linearities
- Clock noise simulation
- Feedback with filtering

## Features
- Adjustable delay time with tempo sync
- Filter section for tone shaping
- Drive control for analog-style saturation
- Feedback with low-pass filtering
- Mix control for wet/dry balance

## Building
Requires iPlug2 framework and compatible C++ compiler.

## Usage
- Adjust delay time with the main knob
- Use the filter controls to shape the delay tone
- Add character with the drive control
- Control feedback amount and filtering
- Adjust the mix between wet and dry signals
